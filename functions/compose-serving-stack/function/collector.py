"""The OpenTelemetry collector each inference cluster runs.

It scrapes everything Modelplane installs, renames what it scraped onto the
modelplane_* surface, merges each deployment's replicas into one series, and
exports to the destination.

Rendered here rather than through the OpenTelemetry Operator: its
OpenTelemetryCollector CRD would be one more operator on every GPU cluster to
install, own and upgrade, for a Deployment and a ConfigMap that this composes
directly. The receiver does its own Kubernetes service discovery, so nothing
here needs the operator's target allocator either.
