"""Read a cluster's resources through the Kubernetes API.

The official Kubernetes client returns typed objects and typed errors for the
built-in kinds. Cluster wraps the parts of it that need care: Modelplane's own
resources, which come back as dicts for the tests to validate into the
generated models, a command's exit code, and container logs.
